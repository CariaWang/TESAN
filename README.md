# PyTorch Implementation of TESAN

This repo contains the code for our WWW 2020 paper: [An End-to-end Topic-Enhanced Self-Attention Network for Social Emotion Classification](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3366423.3380286). Some code is based on [prodLDA](https://github.com/hyqneuron/pytorch-avitm). Thanks for sharing the code.

# Requirements

- python 3.5
