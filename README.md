# PyTorch Implementation of TESAN

This repo contains the code for our WWW 2020 paper: [An End-to-end Topic-Enhanced Self-Attention Network for Social Emotion Classification](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3366423.3380286).

# Requirements

- python 3.5
- pytorch 0.3.1
- numpy
- pickle

# File Discription

- `load_data.py`: the code for loading the dataset
- `parameter.py`: contains the parameters of TESAN
- `model_tesan.py`: the code of the TESAN model
- `tesan.py`: the code for training and testing TESAN
- `word2vec.pickle`: the pre-trained word2vec model.
- `dataset/`
  - `SemEval_wo_swltf.txt`: SemEval 2007 Task 14 dataset. The stopwords and low frequency words are removed.
  - `data_bow_ltf.npy`: the bag-of-words(BOW) vector of each sample in the dataset.
  - `label.npy`: the label of each sample.
